# About Game
Duck is the ambitious owner of a newly-opened bakery. However, to truly kickstart his business, he must first gather some ingredients and, most importantly, the Golden Bread. Rumors say that such a bread dwells within the deepest lair of the dungeons, guarded by the Great Big Goose. <br>
The main objective is to collect all of the bread on each level. Only by doing so can the player unlock gates to the next level. If a bread is missed, then the level must be rstarted. There are three levels; the last one is the boss fight. <br>
The player can move and jump via the arrow keys and space key, shoot bullets by pressing Z (level 3 Only). <br> <br>
